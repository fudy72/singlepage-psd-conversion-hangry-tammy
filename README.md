# The First Project of Many!

This project was the first that I completed in Juno College's Web Development Immersive Bootcamp. It is a straightforward, one page psd conversion that is sure you make you hungry ;)

It was a challenging task for a beginner learning to code. The culprit is applying CSS Floats to achieve the page's layout. The struggle was real but I learned a ton.
